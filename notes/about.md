### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Gregory Axler, I work with deep learning and computer vision. 

I also love systems programming especially the parts that relate to deep learning training infra. I mostly work with Python (PyTorch, JAX), love Rust and sometimes work with C/C++ and CUDA.

This website is my note dump for paper reading and other stuff that I find interesting or need professionally.
