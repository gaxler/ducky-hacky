## Usage
- Fork this repo
- There's an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault under `notes` folder here. You can adapt it as your own and push
- A github action and a hacky `build.py` script will turn the vault into a GithubPages website for the notes
- It supports: latex,code highlighting, images, [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) discussions and appends backlinks to the end of the page 

### Published website structure
1. Navigation bar - get generated from top level markdown page under `notes` folder
2. Notes - Pages in all other subfolders of `notes` are turned into notes pages
3. All Notes - page is autogenerated and added to nav-bar
 
### Properties of pages
You can set 3 (optional) properties to pages in the frontmatter

1. **title** - the title of the page to be displayed (if not set file name is used)
2. **date** - date of page (used for sorting all post from new to old). if not set, file creation date is used
3. **disqus** - name for a disqus website to be embedded at the end of the page (nothing happens if not set)

### Things to watch for
- Set default subfolder for the notes, all top level pages under `notes` will get turned into nav-bar items, so maybe .
- Make sure that Obsidian keeps links in markdown format and absolute path in vault(this is already set in the default vault)
- **Never tested but probably works with other markdown editors** Script only assumes markdown files and dollar sign for inline latex and double dollar sign for block latex.
- **Disqus** - you can add a Disqus threads to notes by specifying frontmatter fields `disqus` and set fields value to the name of your disqus site
